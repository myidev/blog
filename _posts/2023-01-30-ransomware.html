Ransomware attackers hit businesses, organizations, and individuals alike.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Also for Mac, iOS, Android, and Business</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">All about ransomware attacks</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Ransomware made headlines throughout 2021 and continues to make news in 2022. You may have heard stories of attacks on large companies, organizations, or government agencies, or perhaps you as an individual have experienced a ransomware attack on your own device. It’s a significant problem and a scary prospect to have all of your files and data held hostage until you pay up. If you want to know more about this threat, read on to learn about ransomware’s different forms, how you get it, where it comes from, who it targets, and ultimately, what you can do to protect against it.</p><h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">Don't let ransomware take over your device.</h3><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Make sure your device is protected from ransomware.</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">What is ransomware?</h2><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">Ransomware definition</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Ransomware is a form of&nbsp;malware&nbsp;that encrypts a victim's files. The attacker then demands a ransom from the victim to restore access to the data upon payment.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Users are shown instructions for how to pay a fee to get the decryption key. The costs can range from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars, payable to cybercriminals in Bitcoin.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">&nbsp;</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Ransomware, also known as ransomware, is a type of malware that prevents users from accessing their systems or personal files and demands a ransom payment in order to regain access. While some people might think "a virus locked my computer," ransomware would typically be classified as a different form of malware than a virus. The earliest variants of ransomware were developed in the late 1980s, and payment was to be sent via snail mail. Today, ransomware authors order that payment be sent via cryptocurrency or credit card, and attackers target individuals, businesses, and organizations of all kinds. Some ransomware authors sell the service to other cybercriminals, which is known as ransomware-as-a-service, or RaaS.</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">Ransomware attacks</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">How exactly does a threat actor carry out a ransomware attack? First, they must gain access to a device or network. Having access enables them to utilize the malware needed to encrypt, or lock up, your device and data. There are several different ways that ransomware can infect your computer.</p><h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">How do I get ransomware?</h3><h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">Encrypting files and demanding a ransom</h3><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Whichever method the threat actor uses, once they gain access and the ransomware software (typically activated by the victim clicking a link or opening an attachment) encrypts your files or data so you can't access them, you'll then see a message demanding a ransom payment to restore what they took. Often, the attacker will demand payment via cryptocurrency.</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">Types of ransomware</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Three main types of ransomware include scareware, screen lockers, and encrypting ransomware.</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">Mac ransomware</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Not ones to be left out of the ransomware game, Mac malware authors dropped the first ransomware for Mac OSes in 2016. Called KeRanger, the ransomware infected an app called Transmission that, when launched, copied malicious files that remained running quietly in the background for three days until they detonated and encrypted files. Thankfully, Apple’s built-in anti-malware program XProtect released an update soon after the ransomware was discovered that would block it from infecting user systems. Nevertheless, Mac ransomware is no longer theoretical.&nbsp;</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Following KeRanger were Findzip and MacRansom, both discovered in 2017. More recently in 2020, there was what looked like ransomware (ThiefQuest, aka EvilQuest), but it turned out it was actually what is called a "wiper." It pretended to be ransomware as a cover for the fact that it was stealing all your data, and although it encrypted files, it never had a way for users to decrypt them or contact the gang about payments.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">Mobile ransomware</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">It wasn’t until the height of the infamous CryptoLocker family and other similar families in 2014 that ransomware was seen on a large scale on mobile devices. Mobile ransomware typically displays a message that the device has been locked due to some type of illegal activity. The message states that the phone will be unlocked after a fee is paid. Mobile ransomware is often delivered via malicious apps and requires that you boot the phone up in safe mode and delete the infected app in order to retrieve access to your mobile device.</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">Who do ransomware authors target?</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">When ransomware was introduced (and then re-introduced), its initial victims were individual systems (aka "regular people"). However, cybercriminals began to realize its full potential when they rolled out ransomware to businesses. Ransomware was so successful against businesses, halting productivity and resulting in lost data and revenue, that its authors turned most of their attacks toward them.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">By the end of 2016, 12.3 percent of global enterprise detections were ransomware, while only 1.8 percent of consumer detections were ransomware worldwide. By 2017, 35 percent of small and medium-sized businesses had experienced a ransomware attack. Fast forward to the global pandemic in 2020, and the threat persists: Ransomware gangs attacked hospitals and medical facilities and developed new tactics like "double extortion," in which attackers are able to extort more money with threats to leak sensitive data than by decrypting computers they encrypted. Some ransomware groups offer their services to others using a ransomware-as-a-service, or RaaS, model.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Geographically, ransomware attacks are still focused on western markets, with the UK, US, and Canada ranking as the top three countries targeted, respectively. As with other threat actors, ransomware authors will follow the money, so they look for areas that have both wide PC adoption and relative wealth. As emerging markets in Asia and South America ramp up on economic growth, expect to see an increase in ransomware (and other forms of malware) there as well.</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">How can I remove ransomware?</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">They say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. This is certainly true when it comes to ransomware. If an attacker encrypts your device and demands a ransom, there’s no guarantee they will unencrypt it whether or not you pay up.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">That is why it’s critical to be prepared before you get hit with ransomware. Two key steps to take are:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">If you do find yourself with a ransomware infection, the number one rule is to never pay the ransom. (This is now advice&nbsp;endorsed by the FBI.) All that does is encourage cybercriminals to launch additional attacks against either you or someone else.&nbsp;</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">One potential option for removing ransomware is that you may be able to retrieve some encrypted files by using free decryptors. To be clear: Not all ransomware families have had decryptors created for them, in many cases because the ransomware is utilizing advanced and sophisticated encryption algorithms. And even if there is a decryptor, it’s not always clear if it’s for the right version of the malware. You don’t want to further encrypt your files by using the wrong decryption script. Therefore, you’ll need to pay close attention to the ransom message itself, or perhaps ask the advice of a security or IT specialist, before trying anything.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Other ways to deal with a ransomware infection include downloading a security product known for remediation and running a scan to remove the threat. You may not get your files back, but you can rest assured that the infection will be cleaned up. For screenlocking ransomware, a full system restore might be in order. If that doesn’t work, you can try running a scan from a bootable CD or USB drive.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">If you want to try and thwart an encrypting ransomware infection in action, you’ll need to stay particularly vigilant. If you notice your system slowing down for seemingly no reason, shut it down and disconnect it from the Internet. If, once you boot up again, the malware is still active, it will not be able to send or receive instructions from the command and control server. That means without a key or way to extract payment, the malware may stay idle. At that point, download and install a security product and run a full scan.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">However, these options for removing ransomware will not work in all cases. As noted above, consumers should be proactive in their defense against ransomware by installing security software like Malwarebytes Premium and backing up all of their important data. For businesses, learn more about Malwarebytes' business solutions that include ransomware detection, prevention, and rollback.</p><h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">&nbsp;</h3><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">How ransomware works</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">There are a number of vectors ransomware can use to access a computer. One of the most common delivery systems is phishing spam — attachments that come to the victim in an email, masquerading as files they should trust. Once they're downloaded and opened, they can take over the victim's computer, especially if they have built-in social engineering tools that trick users into allowing administrative access. Some other, more aggressive forms of ransomware, like NotPetya, exploit security holes to infect computers without needing to trick users.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">There are several things the malware might do once it’s taken over the victim's computer, but by far the most common action is to encrypt some or all of the user's files. If you want the technical details, the Infosec Institute has a great, in-depth look at how several flavors of ransomware encrypt files. But the most important thing to know is that at the end of the process, the files cannot be decrypted without a mathematical key known only to the attacker. The user is presented with a message explaining that their files are now inaccessible and will only be decrypted if the victim sends an untraceable Bitcoin payment to the attacker.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">In some forms of malware, the attacker might claim to be a law enforcement agency shutting down the victim's computer due to the presence of pornography or pirated software on it and demanding the payment of a "fine," perhaps to make victims less likely to report the attack to authorities. But most attacks don't bother with this pretense. There is also a variation, called leakware or doxware, in which the attacker threatens to publicize sensitive data on the victim's hard drive unless a ransom is paid. But because finding and extracting such information is a very tricky proposition for attackers, encryption ransomware is by far the most common type.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3"><br /></p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">How do I protect myself from ransomware?</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Security experts agree that the best way to protect against ransomware is to prevent it from happening in the first place.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">While there are methods to deal with a ransomware infection, they are imperfect solutions at best and often require much more technical skill than the average computer user. So here’s what we recommend people do in order to avoid the fallout from ransomware attacks.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">The first step in ransomware prevention is to invest in awesome cybersecurity—a program with real-time protection that’s designed to thwart advanced malware attacks such as ransomware. You should also look out for features that will both shield vulnerable programs from threats (an anti-exploit technology) and block ransomware from holding files hostage (an anti-ransomware component). Customers who were using the premium version of Malwarebytes for Windows, for example, were protected from all of the major ransomware attacks of 2017.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Next, as much as it may hurt, you need to create secure backups of your data on a regular basis. Our recommendation is to use cloud storage that includes high-level encryption and multifactor authentication. However, you can purchase USBs or an external hard drive where you can save new or updated files—just be sure to physically disconnect the devices from your computer after backing up, otherwise they can become infected with ransomware, too.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Then, be sure your systems and software are updated. The WannaCry ransomware outbreak took advantage of a vulnerability in Microsoft software. While the company had released a patch for the security loophole back in March 2017, many folks didn’t install the update, which left them open to attack. We get that it’s hard to stay on top of an ever-growing list of updates from an ever-growing list of software and applications used in your daily life. That’s why we recommend changing your settings to enable automatic updating.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Finally, stay informed. One of the most common ways that computers are infected with ransomware is through social engineering. Educate yourself (and your employees, if you’re a business owner) on how to detect spam, suspicious websites, and other scams. And above all else, exercise common sense. If it seems suspect, it probably is.</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">How does ransomware affect my business?</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">GandCrab, SamSam, WannaCry, and NotPetya—they’re all different types of ransomware, and they’re hitting businesses hard. In fact, ransomware attacks on businesses went up 88% in the second half of 2018 as cybercriminals pivot away from consumer-focused attacks. Cybercriminals recognize that big business translates to big payoffs, targeting hospitals, government agencies, and commercial institutions. All told, the average cost of a data breach, including remediation, penalties, and ransomware payouts, works out to $3.86 million.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">The majority of ransomware cases as of late have been identified as GandCrab. First detected in January of 2018, GandCrab has already gone through several versions as the threat authors make their ransomware harder to defend against and strengthen its encryption. It’s been estimated GandCrab has already raked in somewhere around $300 million in paid ransoms, with individual ransoms set from $600 to $700,000.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">In another notable attack that happened back in March of 2018, the SamSam ransomware crippled the City of Atlanta by knocking out several essential city services, including revenue collection and the police record keeping system. All told, the SamSam attack cost Atlanta $2.6 million to remediate.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Considering the spate of ransomware attacks and the tremendous cost associated with them, now is a good time to get smart about protecting your business from ransomware. We’ve covered the topic in great detail previously, but here’s a quick gloss on how to protect your business from malware.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">What do you do if you’re already a victim of ransomware? No one wants to deal with ransomware after the fact.</p><h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m"><br /></h3><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">Who is a target for ransomware?</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">There are several different ways attackers choose the organizations they target with ransomware. Sometimes it's a matter of opportunity: for instance, attackers might target universities because they tend to have smaller security teams and a disparate user base that does a lot of file sharing, making it easier to penetrate their defenses.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">On the other hand, some organizations are tempting targets because they seem more likely to pay a ransom quickly. For instance, government agencies or medical facilities often need immediate access to their files. Law firms and other organizations with sensitive data may be willing to pay to keep news of a compromise quiet, and these organizations may be uniquely sensitive to leakware attacks.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">But don't feel like you're safe if you don't fit these categories. As we noted, some ransomware spreads automatically and indiscriminately across the internet.</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">How to prevent ransomware</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">There are a number of defensive steps you can take to prevent ransomware infection. These steps are, of course, good security practices in general, so following them improves your defenses from all sorts of attacks, including:</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">Ransomware removal</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">If your computer has been infected with ransomware, you'll need to regain control of your machine. CSO's Steve Ragan has a great video demonstrating how to do this on a Windows 10 machine:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">The video has all the details, but the important steps are to:</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">But here's the important thing to keep in mind: while walking through these steps can remove the malware from your computer and restore it to your control, it won't decrypt your files. Their transformation into unreadability has already happened, and if the malware is at all sophisticated, it will be mathematically impossible for anyone to decrypt them without access to the key that the attacker holds. In fact, by removing the malware, you've precluded the possibility of restoring your files by paying the attackers the ransom they've asked for.</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">Ransomware facts and figures</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Ransomware is big business. There's a lot of money in ransomware, and the market has expanded rapidly since the beginning of the decade. In 2017, ransomware resulted in $5 billion in losses, both in terms of ransoms paid and spent, and lost time in recovering from attacks. That's up 15 times from 2015. In the first quarter of 2018, just one kind of ransomware software, SamSam, collected $1 million in ransom money.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Some markets are particularly prone to ransomware—and to paying the ransom. Many high-profile ransomware attacks have occurred in hospitals or other medical organizations, which make tempting targets because attackers know that, with lives literally on the line, these enterprises are more likely to simply pay a relatively low ransom to make a problem go away. It's estimated that 45 percent of ransomware attacks target healthcare organizations, and conversely, 85 percent of malware infections at healthcare organizations are ransomware. Another tempting industry? The financial services sector, which is, as Willie Sutton famously remarked, "where the money is," It's estimated that 90 percent of financial institutions were targeted by a ransomware attack in 2017.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Your anti-malware software won't necessarily protect you. Ransomware is constantly being written and tweaked by its developers, and so its signatures are often not caught by typical anti-virus programs. In fact, as many as 75 percent of companies that fall victim to ransomware were running up-to-date endpoint protection on the infected machines.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Ransomware isn't as prevalent as it used to be. If you want a bit of good news, it's this: the number of ransomware attacks, after exploding in the mid-'10s, has gone into a decline, though the initial numbers were high enough that it's still high. But in the first quarter of 2017, ransomware attacks made up 60 percent of malware payloads; now it's down to 5 percent.</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">Ransomware on the decline?</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">What's behind this big dip? In many ways, it's an economic decision based on the cybercriminal's currency of choice: bitcoin. Extraction of a ransom from a victim has always been hit or miss; they might not decide to pay, or even if they do, they might not be familiar enough with bitcoin to figure out how to actually do so.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">As Kaspersky points out, the decline in ransomware has been matched by a rise in so-called "cryptomining" malware, which infects the victim computer and uses its computing power to create (or mine, in cryptocurrency parlance) bitcoin without the owner knowing. This is a neat route to using someone else's resources to get bitcoin that bypasses most of the difficulties in scoring a ransom, and it has only gotten more attractive as a cyberattack as the price of bitcoin spiked in late 2017.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">That doesn't mean the threat is over, however. There are two different kinds of ransomware attackers: "commodity" attacks that try to infect computers indiscriminately by sheer volume and include so-called "ransomware as a service" platforms that criminals can rent; and targeted groups that focus on particularly vulnerable market segments and organizations. You should be on guard if you're in the latter category, no matter if the big ransomware boom has passed.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">With the price of bitcoin dropping over the course of 2018, the cost-benefit analysis for attackers might shift back. Ultimately, using ransomware or cryptomining malware is a business decision for attackers, says Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at McAfee. "As cryptocurrency prices drop, it’s natural to see a shift back [to ransomware]."</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">Should you pay the ransom?</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">If your system has been infected with malware and you've lost vital data that you can't restore from backup, should you pay the ransom?</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">When speaking theoretically, most law enforcement agencies urge you not to pay ransomware attackers, on the logic that doing so only encourages hackers to create more ransomware. That said, many organizations that find themselves afflicted by malware quickly stop thinking in terms of the "greater good" and start doing a cost-benefit analysis, weighing the price of the ransom against the value of the encrypted data. According to research from Trend Micro, while 66 percent of companies say they would never pay a ransom as a matter of principle, in practice, 65 percent actually do pay the ransom when they get hit.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">Ransomware attackers keep prices relatively low—uusually between $700 and $1,300, an amount companies can usually afford to pay on short notice. Some particularly sophisticated malware will detect the country where the infected computer is running and adjust the ransom to match that nation's economy, demanding more from companies in rich countries and less from those in poor regions.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">There are often discounts offered for acting fast, so as to encourage victims to pay quickly before thinking too much about it. In general, the price point is set so that it's high enough to be worth the criminal's while but low enough that it's often cheaper than what the victim would have to pay to restore their computer or reconstruct the lost data. With that in mind, some companies are beginning to build the potential need to pay ransom into their security plans. For instance, some large UK companies that are otherwise uninvolved with cryptocurrency are holding some Bitcoin in reserve specifically for ransom payments.</p><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">There are a couple of tricky things to remember here, keeping in mind that the people you're dealing with are, of course, criminals. First, what looks like ransomware may not have actually encrypted your data at all; make sure you aren't dealing with so-called "scareware" before you send any money to anybody. And second, paying the attackers doesn't guarantee that you'll get your files back. Sometimes the criminals just take the money and run, and they may not have even built decryption functionality into the malware. But any such malware will quickly get a reputation and won't generate revenue, so in most cases — Gary Sockrider, principal security technologist at Arbor Networks, estimates 65 to 70 percent of the time — the crooks come through and your data is restored.</p><h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-1d1688m">Ransomware examples</h2><p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph css-18wvjs3">While ransomware has technically been around since the 1990s, it's only taken off in the past five years or so, largely because of the availability of untraceable payment methods like Bitcoin.
